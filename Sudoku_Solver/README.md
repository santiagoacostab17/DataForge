# 🧩 Sudoku Solver & Generator

## 📌 Overview
A **Python command-line Sudoku program** that can **generate puzzles** of varying difficulty and **solve them automatically**.  

This project demonstrates **backtracking, recursion, object-oriented programming, and logical problem-solving** in a structured workflow similar to a data analysis pipeline.

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 1️⃣ System Recognition
**Goal:** Understand the problem domain and requirements.  
- **Domain:** Puzzle generation and solving (Sudoku 9x9).  
- **Objective:** Generate solvable puzzles of adjustable difficulty and solve them efficiently.  
- **Constraints:** Must respect Sudoku rules (unique numbers 1–9 per row, column, and 3x3 block).

---

### 2️⃣ Data Collection
**Goal:** Prepare the inputs for the system.  
- Gather the initial empty Sudoku board as a 9x9 grid.  
- Optionally accept **user input** for pre-filled numbers or difficulty selection.  

---

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning
**Goal:** Ensure the board is valid and ready for processing.  
- Verify that initial board numbers (if any) do not violate Sudoku rules.  
- Fill missing cells during generation while maintaining validity.  

---

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze and process the data for insights.  
- Randomized backtracking algorithm fills the board completely.  
- **Check constraints** at every placement to avoid conflicts.  
- Determine cells to remove based on **difficulty level** (20–60 empty cells).  

---

### 5️⃣ Visualization
**Goal:** Present the puzzle in a readable and interactive way.  
- **Console display:** Nicely formatted 9x9 grid.  
- **Image output:** Save as PNG (`sudoku.png` for puzzle, `sudoku_solved.png` for solution).  
- Optional enhancements: color-coded cells, bold 3x3 block separators.  

---

### 6️⃣ Insights / Solver Output
**Goal:** Produce actionable results.  
- Solve any valid puzzle automatically using **recursive backtracking**.  
- Output the **solved board** to console and optionally as a PNG image.  
- Demonstrates efficiency of algorithm and correctness of generation.
